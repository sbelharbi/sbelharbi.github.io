### Tutorial Abstract

Deep learning (DL) models, and in particular CNNs, provide state-of-the-art performance in many visual recognition applications, such as image classification and object localization, and segmentation. However, they remain complex  models with millions of parameters that typically require supervised end-to-end training on large annotated datasets. Weakly supervised learning (WSL) has recently emerged as an appealing approach to mitigate the cost and burden of annotating large datasets, by exploiting data with limited or coarse labels. In particular, WSL is largely beneficial in object localization and semantic segmentation tasks, to avoid a  costly annotation process, to extract bounding boxes and dense segmentation. Weakly-supervised object localization (WSOL) and weakly-supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) methods have drawn much attention because they rely on less costly annotation such as image-class labels.

In this tutorial, we aim to provide a review of the recent progress with deep WSOL/WSSS models, and their applications in pattern recognition and computer vision. We will highlight recent trends, advantages and drawbacks, and key insights on these powerful models. In addition, we discuss current challenges facing both tasks.

### Tutorial Outline

Our tutorial will cover the following topics:
- A general introduction to learning with weak-supervision: different types of settings for weak-supervision, and their application in localization and segmentation. Inter-connection of WSOL/WSSS models proposed for different tasks and domains, such as object localization, segmentation, visual interpretation of deep learning models.
- Review of deep WSOL methods, with focus on Class Activation Map (CAM) methods which are at the  core of these models.
- Review of state-of-the art deep WSSS methods.
- Overview of CAM methods for visual interpretability of deep learning models.
- Conclusion and future directions.

Post-doc. LIVIA, Dept. of Systems Engineering,  École de technologie supérieure, Montreal, Canada.

Soufiane Belharbi received his Ph.D. in Computer Science in 2018 from the Institut National des Sciences Appliquées de Rouen Normandie (INSA Rouen Normandie), in Litis laboratory. During that time, he conducted research on the regularization of neural networks through representation learning with particular focus on learning scenarios where only few training samples are available. Since 2018, he is pursuing a post-doc position at LIVIA laboratory, École de technologie supérieure, Montreal in collaboration with McCaffrey laboratory and GCRC at McGill university. His main focus is weakly-supervised learning for localization, and an interest to medical imaging applications. He has publications and regularly reviews in top-tier machine learning and computer vision conferences and journals.
