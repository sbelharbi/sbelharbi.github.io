### Tutorial Abstract

Deep learning models, and in particular CNNs, provide state-of-the-art performance in many visual recognition applications, such as image classification, object localization and detection, and segmentation. However, they remain complex models with millions of parameters that typically require supervised end-to-end training on large annotated datasets. Weakly supervised learning (WSL) has recently emerged as an appealing approach to mitigate the cost and burden of annotating large datasets, by exploiting data with limited or coarse labels. In particular, WSL is largely beneficial in object localization and semantic segmentation tasks, to avoid the costly process of extracting bounding boxes and dense pixel-wise annotations. Weakly-supervised object localization (WSOL) and weakly-supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) methods have drawn much attention because they rely on less costly annotation such as image-class labels.

This tutorial provides a detailed review of the recent progress with deep WSOL/WSSS models, and their applications in pattern recognition and computer vision. The tutorial will cover the fundamental principles, recent trends and developments, key challenges, and insights on these powerful models. In addition, the tutorial is accompanied by various examples where deep WSOL/WSSS models are applied to solve real-world problems in, e.g, visual recognition and medical image analysis.

Post-doc. LIVIA, Dept. of Systems Engineering,  École de technologie supérieure, Montreal, Canada.

Soufiane Belharbi received his Ph.D. in Computer Science in 2018 from the Institut National des Sciences Appliquées de Rouen Normandie (INSA Rouen Normandie), in Litis laboratory. During that time, he conducted research on the regularization of neural networks through representation learning with particular focus on learning scenarios where only few training samples are available. Since 2018, he is pursuing a post-doc position at LIVIA laboratory, École de technologie supérieure, Montreal in collaboration with McCaffrey laboratory and GCRC at McGill university. His main focus is weakly-supervised learning for localization, and an interest in medical imaging applications. He has publications, and regularly reviews in top-tier machine learning and computer vision conferences and journals.
